## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

## Run code

- `build`: cd src/ && javac -cp ".;..\lib\jsoup-1.13.1.jar" .\crawler\MainClass.java
- `run`: java -cp ".;..\lib\jsoup-1.13.1.jar" crawler.MainClass
